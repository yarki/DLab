  <h3>Generating SSH key pair on Microsoft Windows</h3>
  <p>You can use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> to generate your SSH key. PuTTY is a free open-source terminal emulator that functions much like the Terminal application in Mac OS X in a Windows environment.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Please download PuTTYgen program by using <a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe">this link</a>.</li>
    <li>Open the PuTTYgen program.</li>
    <li>For Type of key to generate, select SSH-2 RSA.</li>
    <li>Click the Generate button.</li>
    <li>Move your mouse in the area below the progress bar. When the progress bar is full, PuTTYgen generates your key pair.</li>
    <li>Type a passphrase in the Key passphrase field. Type the same passphrase in the Confirm passphrase field. You can use a key without a passphrase, but this is not recommended.</li>
    <li>Click the Save private key button to save the private key. Warning! You must save the private key. You will need it to connect to your machine.</li>
    <li>Click the Save public key to save your public key (this key shall be uploaded using Web UI of Dlab).</li>

    <div>You can use Cygwin if you want for SSH key generation. In order to generate key using Cygwin please follow these steps:</div>

    <li>Open Cygwin shell.</li>
    <li>Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present</li>
    <li>Enter following command and write appropriate email address:</li>

    <div class="code-block">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<span class="txt-color-yellow">your_email@example.com</span>"</div>

    <li>When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.</li>
    <li>At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.</li>

    <h3>Generating SSH key pair on MAC OS / Linux</h3>
    <li>Open Terminal</li>
    <li>Enter following command and write appropriate email address</li>

    <div class="code-block">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<span class="txt-color-yellow">your_email@example.com</span>"</div>

    <li>This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.</li>

    <div class="code-block txt-color-green">Generating public/private rsa key pair.</div>

    <li>When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.</li>

    <div class="code-block txt-color-green">Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/<span class="txt-color-yellow">you</span>/.ssh/id_rsa): <span class="txt-color-yellow">[Press enter]</span></div>

    <li>At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.</li>

    <div class="code-block txt-color-green">Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <span class="txt-color-yellow">[Type a passphrase]</span> Enter same passphrase again: <span class="txt-color-yellow">[Type passphrase again]</span></div>
  </ul>
